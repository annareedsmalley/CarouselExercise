# CarouselExercise

This took me over 20 hours, and there are still problems. 
The only parts I didn't attempt were the delays. (Thought I would have time to come back to them later.)
I attempted everything else that was required, but ended up having to use workarounds for a few things, which is why some things ended up looking ugly.
This code also produces a runtime error that doesn't stop/crash the code, but is worrisome.
I see Tim just posted a reply to my question about this error on Facebook, but will have to read it tomorrow.
